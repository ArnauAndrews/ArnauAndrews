### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arnau Andrews, a recent graduate with a degree in International Business and Marketing, and a Master's Degree in Big Data and Data Science, currently exploring opportunities in the field of data analytics and data science.

I have gained practical experience through various projects, including:

- Credit Card Risk Analysis
- Customer Demographics Analysis
- Market Basket Analysis
- Time Series Dashboard
- WiFi Indoor Analysis Tracking

and many others!

These projects have allowed me to develop skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques. I am eager to apply my knowledge and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes.

Let's connect and discuss how my background in Data Science, combined with my project experience, can bring value to your data analytics or data science team!
